# matplotlib-challenge
This challenge was an interesting one that I did find to be a bit cheesy....puns aside the important thing to note is that I did not make a new file for my solution, I used the starter code file and adjusted it until it became the final solution. The folder is setup how it should be with the solution file being in Pymaceuticals and the sources of data being in the Data folder. I wasn't initally sure what to call this challenge repository because up to this point we've been given clear instructions on what to specifically name it. Given that I did not find those instructions I opted to call it the matplotlib challenge due to how much matplotlib is being tested here.  The analysis of the data is also inside the starter code file as well instead of in a docx file like last time. Everything was tested and should run fine!
